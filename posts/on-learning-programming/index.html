<p>A programming language is a means for instructing a computer to perform operations. To distinguish itself from the others, each programming language decides on the fundamentals it will provide to facilitate describing and organizing these operations. There is no objective reason behind what will or will not be provided. Hypothetically, a language could be made that provides all of the methods created to describe operations. In practice though, it never happens. It begs the question. Why is that?</p>
<h2 id="a-line-is-always-drawn">A line is always drawn</h2>
<p>One way of doing things is eventually preferred over another. Programmers enjoy heuristics. One can only hold so many ideas in their mind before something slips from their grasp. Rules of thumb allow for snappier judgments and quicker results.</p>
<p>Those mental shortcuts may not always lead to rational and accurate conclusions. But there&rsquo;s no need to worry. That is a sacrifice a language developer is willing to make for you.</p>
<h2 id="you-need-to-understand-your-instruments">You need to understand your instruments</h2>
<p>Programming languages are similar to genres, movements and styles in other creative fields. They aren&rsquo;t defined only by what they&rsquo;re doing but also how, why, and when they do what they do.</p>
<p>Consider the guitarist. A guitarist can make various sounds. But depending on the venue, the audience expects their guitar to make certain sounds. If they&rsquo;re playing for a metal band, distortion and overdrive must follow.</p>
<p>It was written. How else will I commune with the gods of metal in the pit?</p>
<p>A jazz festival will have different expectations. Hip hop will every now and then call the guitarist into the studio to avoid sampling an obscure funk riff, but the guitarist knows not to count on it.</p>
<p>In each scenario, they play the same instrument. Sometimes even the same chords. But the how, why and when make all the difference. The musician is required to understand their audience&rsquo;s expectations.</p>
<h2 id="meet-greyson-nekrutman">Meet Greyson Nekrutman.</h2>
<p><img src="https://drumeoblog.s3.amazonaws.com/beat/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/04141804/0203-Greyson-Photo-scaled-e1596578858213.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>You can always count on Greyson to keep a beat. Born in 2002, he&rsquo;s played the drums since the age of four. At the age of nineteen, Greyson was taking on big band classics that even veterans have trouble performing.</p>
<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
      <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen" loading="eager" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AwPCbmTXsiA?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" title="YouTube video"></iframe>
    </div>

<p>With Greyson in your band, you&rsquo;re the &lsquo;07 Cavaliers of bands. You&rsquo;re median but the heights you can reach are beyond expectation because one person really can tip the scales in your favor.</p>
<p>But Greyson doesn&rsquo;t limit himself only to the world of jazz. It&rsquo;s where he started to make a name for himself, but it isn&rsquo;t his only home. Nowadays he plays for the Brazilian heavy metal band, Sepultura.</p>
<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
      <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen" loading="eager" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JtcbQlaEZzM?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" title="YouTube video"></iframe>
    </div>

<p>Despite the two videos being of the same drummer, the only thing they share in common is sweating. When playing jazz, he constantly and consistently switches between different rhythms, stringing them together into a beautiful solo. With Sepultura, Greyson is a different animal, but very much the same beast. He lets loose and is more aggressive in his play style.</p>
<p>Greyson understands his audience.</p>
<h2 id="understand-the-standards-and-hold-yourself-to-them">Understand the standards and hold yourself to them</h2>
<p>Just as Greyson understands that drumming changes in accordance with the audience, developers need to come to a similar understanding when programming. Programming languages bring their own expectations of how things should be done. They prime themselves according to those expectations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the developer&rsquo;s duty then to discover and understand these expectations. If not, they will find themselves struggling, holding themselves back from realizing their potential.</p>
<p>Everybody is entitled to their preferences but we shouldn&rsquo;t hold ourselves back. Programming languages expect their users to align with their preconceived notions. When we don&rsquo;t align ourselves, it&rsquo;s as if we&rsquo;re out in the ocean, swimming against the rip currents. We become so focused on reaching land that we exhaust ourselves until we drown in code.</p>
<p>But if we align ourselves with the language, its currents will guide us to a different location but land nonetheless. Maturity as a programmer is understanding that programming isn&rsquo;t a technical marvel, but a social one as well. Understanding and accepting this social factor is what separates the good from the best.</p>
