          <p>If there&rsquo;s one thing I enjoy about being a software engineer, it&rsquo;s the typing.</p>
<p>Everything else frustrates me occasionally. This doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t enjoy those aspects of the job. Debugging errors piques my curiosity. Designing systems with my peers keeps me sharp. Building software <em>is</em> fun. But I also know how much sleep those shenanigans have cost me.</p>
<p>Except for typing. Typing always goes smoothly. It&rsquo;s the silver lining that threads everything together. As long as I&rsquo;m typing, it feels like I&rsquo;m moving toward something.</p>
<p>Considering my knack for typing, it should come as no surprise that I live in the terminal. But I&rsquo;m no purist. I don&rsquo;t do <strong>everything</strong> through a shell. I launch my games from Steam. I browse the web with Firefox/Chromium.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m usually booting up my computer to write something. During my day, I will write:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Tests</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>Prompts</li>
<li>Email</li>
<li>Meeting notes</li>
<li>One off notes</li>
<li>Lists</li>
<li>Essays</li>
<li>Scripts</li>
<li>Outlines</li>
</ul>
<p>I <strong>enjoy</strong> typing. While many find the terminal to be a cumbersome interface since one is constrained to the keyboard. This exact feature is what sparks joy in me.</p>
<p>Day to day, I&rsquo;m switching between modes of writing. Since it&rsquo;s all in the terminal, switching between these modes becomes another mode of writing. By always typing, I&rsquo;m never breaking my flow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a simple one-two. I type text. The computer responds. Rinse and repeat. The loop continues until I&rsquo;m finished for the day.</p>
<p>Something interesting about this loop is that it&rsquo;s the same mental loop I use when programming. Thus when I&rsquo;m using my terminal, I&rsquo;m not only typing all the time. I&rsquo;m always programming as well. Two birds, one stone.</p>
<p>Many actions performed in the terminal map directly to programming concepts.</p>
<p>Programs are functions. They receive arguments that configure their behavior and in response, output data.</p>
<p>The shell offers control flow constructs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Files and directories</li>
<li>Standard input, output, error</li>
<li>Globbing</li>
<li>Conditionals</li>
<li>Named/anonymous pipes</li>
<li>Redirection</li>
<li>Process substitution</li>
</ul>
<p>With the wide range of utilities available to us nowadays, it&rsquo;s possible to create robust maintainable shell scripts/daemons that are as Turing complete as any other software. In my experience, leaning into the shell facilitates the development of stable software.</p>
