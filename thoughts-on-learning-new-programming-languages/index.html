          <p>A programming language is a means for instructing a computer to perform operations. To distinguish itself from the others, each programming language decides on the fundamentals it will provide to facilitate describing and organizing these operations. There is no objective reason behind what will or will not be provided. Hypothetically, a language could be made that provides all of the methods created to describe operations. In practice though, it never happens. It begs the question. Why is that so?</p>
<p>A line is always drawn. One way of doing things is preferred over another.  &ldquo;Just one more indirection,&rdquo; the programmer says as they plan their next layer of abstraction.</p>
<p>Programmers also enjoy heuristics. One can only hold so much in their mind before something slips away. A rule of thumb allows for snappier judgments and quicker results. Those mental shortcuts may not always lead to rational and accurate conclusions. But there&rsquo;s no need to worry. That is a sacrifice a language developer is willing to make for you.</p>
<p>This makes programming languages similar to genres, movements and styles in other creative synthetic fields. They aren&rsquo;t defined only by what they&rsquo;re doing but also how, why, and when they do what they do.</p>
<p>A guitarist can make various sounds. But depending on the venue, the audience expects their guitar to make certain sounds. If they&rsquo;re playing for a metal band, distortion and overdrive must follow. It was written.</p>
<p>How else will I commune with the gods of metal in the pit?</p>
<p>A jazz festival will have different expectations. Hip hop doesn&rsquo;t even care about them like that. Occasionally a producer calls you into the studio to avoid sampling an obscure funk riff, but the guitarist knows not to count on it.</p>
<p>In each scenario, they play the same instrument. Even the same chords. But the how, why and when make all the difference. The musician is required to understand their audience.</p>
<p>Language developers are faced with a same dilemma. Their audience is the programmer. A fickle bunch, but decent people. Knowingly or not, programmers have many expectations of how computations should be described and processed. Those expectations interact with each other, converging and diverging among themselves. Language developers identify how these opinions group together and analyze the factors that cause them to separate. Through this, they create languages with the objective of turning those expectations into the path of least resistance.</p>
<p>This is usually where a programmer finds themselves struggling when learning a new language. They bring their preconceived notions and naively map them one to one and not realize that a transformation has to occur as well. The more one does so, the more one holds themselves back. Everybody is entitled to their preferences but one should always be open to other perspectives, especially when you&rsquo;re in another&rsquo;s domain. Maturity as a programmer is understanding that programming isn&rsquo;t a technical marvel, but a social one as well. Understanding and accepting this social factor is what separates the good from the best.</p>
